/*
Concept Tutorial:
JavaScript statements are instructions to be executed by the web browser. 
It is a good practice to end statements with a semicolon, 
especially when they are written on separate lines to avoid unexpected behaviors.
*/

// Corrected Code:
let a = 5;  // Statement ends with a semicolon
let b = 10;  // Statement ends with a semicolon
console.log(a + b);  // Statement ends with a semicolon
